Kim lay in the soft, warm bed. The blankets felt like a big, gentle hug from a friend. The room was very quiet and very still. Outside the window, the moon was shining high in the sky. It was a big, round moon that looked like a silver coin. It cast a soft, white glow across the floor. Kim felt very safe and very cozy. The pillows were fluffy, just like white clouds in a summer sky. Kim took a slow, deep breath. The air in the room was cool and sweet. Everything was peaceful.

In Kim’s mind, it was time for a gentle walk. Kim imagined a beautiful, quiet meadow. In this special place, the ground was made of soft green moss. It felt like a fuzzy, warm carpet under Kim's feet. There were flowers everywhere. Some were pale blue and some were soft pink. They smelled like vanilla and sweet honey. Kim walked very slowly through the tall grass. There was no rush at all. The trees had big, green leaves that whispered shhh every time the wind blew. Kim saw a small pond nearby. The water was very still and clear. It looked like a silver mirror. Kim waved a hand at the water, and the water waved back with tiny, slow ripples.

As Kim walked, a little friend appeared. It was a tiny, fluffy squirrel with a very long tail. The squirrel looked a little bit worried. It was looking for something special. The squirrel had lost its favorite velvet acorn. This was a very soft acorn that the squirrel liked to use as a pillow. Kim wanted to help the little friend. Kim looked under a big, crunchy orange leaf. The acorn was not there. Kim looked near a smooth, round gray stone. The acorn was not there either.

Kim walked over to a bush with soft, purple berries. There, tucked inside a little patch of tall, silver grass, was the velvet acorn. Kim picked it up very carefully. It felt very soft and warm in Kim's hand. Kim walked back to the tiny squirrel and held out the acorn. When Kim gave the squirrel the pillow, the squirrel felt very happy and calm. The squirrel gave Kim a little nod of thanks and curled up right there on the moss. Now the squirrel could take a long, peaceful nap. Kim felt very good for helping a friend. It was a small challenge, and now everything was perfect again.

The sun was beginning to set in the meadow. The sky was turning a very pretty shade of lavender and soft orange. Kim started to feel a little bit tired. Kim’s legs felt heavy and very relaxed. It was time to go back to the cozy room. Kim walked back through the mossy path, feeling slower with every step. The trees whispered goodnight as Kim passed by. The flowers slowly closed their petals to go to sleep for the night.

Now, Kim was back in the warm bed. The blankets were still soft and tucked in tight. Kim felt very, very sleepy. Kim’s toes were sleepy. Kim’s hands were sleepy. Even Kim’s ears felt sleepy. The room was dark and very quiet. Kim watched the moonlight move slowly across the wall. Kim took another deep breath. The tummy went up and the tummy went down.

Kim closed their eyes and felt the softness of the pillow. It was time for happy dreams. The whole world was sleeping now. The birds were tucked in their nests. The squirrels were sleeping in the trees. Kim was safe and warm in bed. Everything was exactly as it should be. Kim felt loved and very peaceful. Sleep was coming now, just like a soft, heavy blanket. Goodnight, Kim. Sleep well.
